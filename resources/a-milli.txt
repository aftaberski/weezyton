A millionaire
I'm a Young Money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease
Like a menstrual, bleed through the pencil
I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers ha-ha-ha-ha,
you can't catch 'em,
you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules,
if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em,
you can't man 'em then you mop 'em,
you can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
